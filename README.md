# ledcube.rs

Controller for LED Cubes using pure Rust. It runs on the awesome [Sipeed Longan Nano](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Sipeed-Longan-Nano/tree/master/res) RISC-V dev board (ordered it on seeedstudio). While RISC-V seems to gain traction lately it can unfortunately not yet be used for my daily workloads. But it fascinates me to combine this very new CPU with oldschool analog technology. I also choose it because Rust support is very good.

Small demo of the first 5x5x5 cube I made:

I plan on building more cubes using a more convenient wiring schema though. Maybe I'll also upload the schema and parts list in the future.
